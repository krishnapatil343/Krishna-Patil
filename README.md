"Welcome to All! ðŸŒŠ We're dedicated to leveraging cutting-edge technology to detect water bodies using satellite imagery. Our focus is on environmental monitoring, disaster management, and sustainable resource utilization. Join us as we explore the beauty of Earth's landscapes and work towards a better, more water-conscious future.
# *Water Detection*: example at Huallaga River (Meander),Peru.
Water detection identifies the presence or absence of water in a given area. It is crucial for various applications in multiple sectors, including environmental monitoring, agriculture, urban planning and disaster management.
Accurate water sensing allows us to assess water availability, monitor changes in water bodies, predict floods or droughts, and manage water resources effectively.
The code is based on the compilation of satellite images (more than 30 years old) and determining areas of water, sand, and other elements. For this analysis, CoastSat's code is being used.

The software application refers to a sandy beach, with various cases being validated. Future projects it is expected to implement this code initially focused on coasts and expand it to rivers.
